## Logistic Regression Model

## Overview
The project involves the development and evaluation of a machine learning model, likely focused on binary classification. The primary objective is to predict outcomes based on a set of features, with a particular emphasis on assessing the model's ability to distinguish between two classes (0 and 1). The model has been trained and evaluated using standard metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, along with the overall accuracy.
