## Logistic Regression Model

## Overview
The project involves the development and evaluation of a machine learning model, likely focused on binary classification. The primary objective is to predict outcomes based on a set of features, with a particular emphasis on assessing the model's ability to distinguish between two classes (0 and 1). The model has been trained and evaluated using standard metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, along with the overall accuracy.
## Installation

Provide instructions on how to install and set up the project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Archit03/Logistic-Regression
cd Logistic-Regression
#install the dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the script.
```bash
#usage
python LG.py
```
Please make sure you have a 'salary1.csv' file in the same directory as the Python script. 

Preprocessing
Explain the steps taken to preprocess the data, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and any other relevant preprocessing steps.

Models
Provide details about the machine learning models used in your project. Include information on how to train and evaluate the models.

Results
