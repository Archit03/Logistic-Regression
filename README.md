## Logistic Regression Model

## Overview
The project involves the development and evaluation of a machine learning model, likely focused on binary classification. The primary objective is to predict outcomes based on a set of features, with a particular emphasis on assessing the model's ability to distinguish between two classes (0 and 1). The model has been trained and evaluated using standard metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, along with the overall accuracy.
## Installation

Models
In this project, the primary machine learning model utilized is the Logistic Regression algorithm, implemented through the LogisticRegression class from the scikit-learn library. Logistic Regression is a well-established method for binary classification tasks, making it suitable for predicting outcomes within the two defined classes (0 and 1).
